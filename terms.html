      <p class="sh-elem"><a href="https://gamebot.club/">GameBot.club</a> ("GameBot.club", "our website", "the system") was created and is maintained by <a href="https://simoesh.com">Hugo Simoes</a> ("I", "we", "us") and its purpose is to facilitate building both a community of gamers ("gamers", "users") who play our daily challenges, as well as a community of developers ("developers", "coders", "users") of bots ("PrequelBots") written in the <a href="https://prequel-lang.org">Prequel programming language</a>.</p>
      <p class="sh-elem">In order to sign up for a GameBot.club account, users need a confirmed email address in their (separate) <a href="https://www.libravatar.org">Libravatar account</a>.<br/>
	Alternative sign in with third-party services may be available, but users will still need a Libravatar account if they ever decide to delete their GameBot.club account.</p>
      <p class="sh-elem">We provide games where the system generates a different challenge every day, so that different users can be solving the same challenge at a given moment.<br/>
        We also provide Prequel programming games where users can upload a PrequelBot and debug it in matches computed by the system.<br/>
        Each game has a leaderboard publicly showing the avatars of the top users.</p>
      <p class="sh-elem">To enjoy the games at our website, users can choose one of several membership plans.<br/>
        Additionally, for increased flexibility, micro-subscriptions are also available for most games.<br/>
        Subscription plans and micro-subscriptions allow each user to tailor their gaming experience according to their individual interests.<br/>
        Details regarding the available subscription plans and micro-subscriptions can be found in <a href="#pricing">Pricing</a>.</p>
      <p class="sh-elem">Payments of subscription plans and micro-subscriptions are made with our virtual currency named Precoins.<br/>
        Users can buy Precoins, only at our website, with a credit card through <a href="https://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a>.<br/>
        Note that each game has a limit on the number of active users enjoying them and, as such, some games may only be available to users who have already taken the opportunity to explicitly subscribe to them.</p>
      <p class="sh-elem">Details regarding data collection can be found in our <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.<br/>
        Users can delete their accounts at any time, but lose all unused Precoins.<br/>
        Accounts are automatically deleted after two years of login inactivity, and lose all unused Precoins.<br/>
        Accounts can be suspended if cheating or improper use of our website is detected.</p>
      <p class="sh-elem">Please do not use our GameBot.club website if you do not agree to these terms, to our pricing, or to our privacy policy.<br/>
        In that case, we would appreciate if you express your concerns using the email address found at the bottom of the <a href="https://simoesh.com">author's home page</a>.</p>
