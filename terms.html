      <p class="pb-elem"><a href="https://prequelbots.com">PrequelBots.com</a> ("PrequelBots", "our website", "the system") was created and is maintained by <a href="https://simoesh.com">Hugo Simoes</a> ("I", "we", "us") and its purpose is to facilitate building a community of developers ("users") of bots ("PrequelBots") written in the <a href="https://prequel-lang.org">Prequel programming language</a>.</p>
      <p class="pb-elem">In order to sign up for a PrequelBots account, users need a confirmed email address in their <a href="https://www.libravatar.org">Libravatar account</a>.<br/>
	We provide Prequel programming games where users can upload a PrequelBot and debug it in matches computed by the system.<br/>
	For each programming game, we also provide a leaderboard for the top 10 PrequelBots on each available mode.</p>
      <p class="pb-elem">To enjoy the programming games at our website, users need to unlock the programming games they are interested in and they also need to have their annual subscription active for the current year.<br/>
	Payments of programming games and annual subscriptions are made with our virtual currency named Precoins.<br/>
	Users can buy Precoins in our shop through <a href="https://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a>.<br/>
	Note that each programming game has a limit on the number of active users enjoying them and, as such, some games may only be available to users who have already taken the opportunity to unlock them.</p>
      <p class="pb-elem">Details regarding data collection can be found in our <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.<br/>
	Users can delete their accounts at any time, but loose all unused Precoins.</p>
      <p class="pb-elem">Please do not use our PrequelBots website if you do not agree to these terms or to our privacy policy.<br/>
	In that case, we would appreciate if you express your concerns using the email address found at the bottom of the <a href="https://simoesh.com">author's home page</a>.</p>
