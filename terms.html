      <p class="pb-elem"><a href="https://prequelbots.com">PrequelBots.com</a> ("PrequelBots", "our website") is implemented by <a href="https://simoesh.com">Hugo Simoes</a> ("I", "we", "us") and its purpose is to facilitate the creation of a community of developers ("users") of bots written in the <a href="https://prequel-lang.org">Prequel programming language</a>.</p>
      <p class="pb-elem"><span class="pb-strong">Note that our website is not yet ready for production.</span><br/>
	Although you might choose to sign up for an account, note that currently <span class="pb-strong">all users should expect limited functionality</span>.</p>
      <p class="pb-elem">Nevertheless, we believe that the current implemented features are sufficient to drive the interest of some of our potential users.<br/>
      Additionally, signing up for an account is at the moment cost free, which serves both to acknowledge the current limitations of our service as well as to reward early adopters who still choose to contribute with their time despite said limitations.</p>
      <p class="pb-elem">In order to sign up for a PrequelBots account, users need a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub account</a>.<br/>
      Once logged in to PrequelBots, users can upload a file containing Prequel source code (a PrequelBot).<br/>
      After the upload, users have access to the status of their own PrequelBot, eventually also to its rank.<br/>
      Users can delete their PrequelBot at any time and then upload another file of their choosing.</p>
      <p class="pb-elem">Details regarding data collection can be found in our <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
      <p class="pb-elem">Please do not use our PrequelBots website, if you do not agree to these terms or to our privacy policy.<br/>
      In that case, we would appreciate if you send us an email expressing your concerns to the address found near the bottom of the <a href="https://simoesh.com">author's home page</a>.</p>
